# AI Assistant Configuration File
# This file instructs AI assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.) to read and maintain
# the .ai knowledge base before making any changes to the project.

# READ THIS FIRST
# ===============
# Before starting ANY conversation or making ANY code changes:
# 1. Read .ai/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md - understand project structure
# 2. Read .ai/ISSUES_AND_SOLUTIONS.md - know about past problems
# 3. Read .ai/IMPORTANT_NOTES.md - check critical information
# 4. Read .ai/README.md - understand the system

# WORKFLOW
# ========
# 1. Every new conversation: Read .ai files above
# 2. Before code changes: Check .ai/IMPORTANT_NOTES.md
# 3. After completing tasks: Update .ai/ISSUES_AND_SOLUTIONS.md
# 4. When done: Commit changes with .ai updates

# KEY FILES TO REMEMBER
